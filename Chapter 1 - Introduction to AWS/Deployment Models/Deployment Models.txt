Cloud Computing Deployment Models
    - The two primary cloud computing deployment models are
        - "all-in" cloud-based deployment
        - hybrid deployment

All-in Cloud-Based Deployment
    - Fully deployed in the cloud
        - All components of the application runs in the cloud
    - Applications can either be created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefit of cloud computing
    - Cloud based applications has can be built on
        - Low level infrastructure pieces
        - High level infrastructure that provides an abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure
