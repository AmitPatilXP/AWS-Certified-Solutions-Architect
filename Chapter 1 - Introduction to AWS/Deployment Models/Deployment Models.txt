Cloud Computing Deployment Models
    - The two primary cloud computing deployment models are
        - "all-in" cloud-based deployment
        - hybrid deployment

All-in Cloud-Based Deployment
    - Fully deployed in the cloud
        - All components of the application runs in the cloud
    - Applications can either be created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefit of cloud computing
    - Cloud based applications has can be built on
        - Low level infrastructure pieces
        - High level infrastructure that provides an abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure

Hybrid Deployment
    - Common approach taken by many enterprises
        - connects infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources, typically in existing data center
    - Hybrid deployment allows cloud resources to extend and grow an organization's existing infrastructure.
        - This is because choosing between an existing investment in infrastructure and moving to cloud does not need to be a binary decision
        - The user can make decisions on choosing cloud, existing infrastructure or a hybrid
