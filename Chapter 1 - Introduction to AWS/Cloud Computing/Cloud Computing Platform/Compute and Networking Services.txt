Compute and Networking Services
    - AWS provides a variety of compute and networking services
        - These compute and networking services can be leverage with the storage, database, and application services to provide a complete
          solution for computing, query processing and storage across a wide range of applications

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
    - Web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
    - Allows organization to obtain and configure virtual servers, and to harness those resources to build and host software systems
    - These resources include
        - Variety of operating systems
        - Resource configurations (memory, CPU, storage)
        - Manage network access permissions

AWS Lambda
    - Zero-administration compute platform for back-end web developers
    - It runs your back-end code on its own AWS compute fleet of Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones in a region,
      which provides the high availability, security, performance and scalability

Auto Scaling
    - Allows organizations to scale Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions defined for the particular workload
    - Help maintain application availability and ensure that the desired number of Amazon EC2 instances are running
    - Well suited both to applications that have stable demand patterns and to applications that experience variability in usage

Elastic Load Balancing
    - Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the cloud
    - Achieve greater level of fault tolerance in applications
    - Seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to distribute application traffic

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
    - Allows organizations provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network
    - Organizations have complete control over the virtual environment
        - Selection of IP address range
        - creation of subnets
        - configuration of route tables
        - network gateways
    - Organizations can extend their corporate data center networks to AWS by using
        - hardware
        - software virtual private network connections
        - AWS direct connect

AWS Direct Connect
    - Allows organizations to establish a dedicated network connection from their data center to AWS
    - Established private connectivity between AWS and their data center, office, or colocation environment
        - reduce network costs
        - increase bandwidth throughput
        - more consistent network experience than Internet-based VPN connections
