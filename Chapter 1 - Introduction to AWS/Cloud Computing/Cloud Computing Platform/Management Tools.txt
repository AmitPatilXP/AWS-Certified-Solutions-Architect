Amazon CloudWatch
    - Monitoring service for AWS Cloud resources and applications running on AWS
        - Allows organizations to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files and set alarms
    - Organizations can gain system wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health
        - These insights allows organizations to react, as necessary, to keep applications running smoothly.

AWS CloudFormation
    - Gives developers and systems administrators an effective way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources
    - Defines a JSON-based templating language that can be used to describe all the AWS resources that are necessary for a workload
        - Templates can be submitted to AWS CloudFormation and the service will take care of provisioning and configuring those resources in appropriate order
            1) Create or use an existing template
            2) Save locally or in S3 bucket
            3) Use AWS CloudFormation to create a stack based on your template
            4) AWS CloudFormation constructs and configures the specific stack resources
