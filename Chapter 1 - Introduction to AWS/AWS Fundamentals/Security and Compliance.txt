      integrity compromise and deletion.
    - By helping to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and data, AWS is able to maintain the trust and confidence of users.

    - Organizations can inherit the best practices of AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes built to satisfy the requirements of the most
      security-sensitive customers.
