Global Infrastructure
    - AWS serves over one million active customers in more than 190 countries.
        - It continues to expand its global infrastructure steadily to help organizations
          achieve lower latency and higher throughput for their business needs
    - Highly available technology infrastructure platform with multiple locations
        - The locations are composed of regions and availability zones
            - Each region is a separate geographic area
            - Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability zones
                - The placement of resources and data in multiple locations and resources are not replicated
                  across regions unless organizations choose to do so.

        - Each region is completely independent and is designed to be completely isolated from other regions.
            - This help to achieve greatest possible fault tolerance and stability

        - Each availability zone is also isolated, but each zone in a region are connected through low-latency links
            - The zones are physically separated within a typical region and are located in lower-risk flood plains.
            - They also use a discrete uninterruptable power supply (UPS) and on-site backup generators.
            - Fed via different grids from independent utilities (when available) to reduce single points of failure.
            - Availability zones are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers.
                - By placing resources in separate Availability zones, you can protect your website or application from a service disruption
                  impacting a single location.
