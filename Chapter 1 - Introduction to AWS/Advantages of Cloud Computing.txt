Variable vs Capital Expense
    - The ability to trade capital expense for variable operational expense
        - Do not need to invest heavily in data centers and servers before knowing how much you are going to use them
        - Cloud computing allows users to pay only when they consume computing resources and pay for how much they consume.

Economies of Scale
    - Organizations benefits from massive economies of scale
        - Cloud computing allows users to achieve a lower variable cost than they would on their own.
        - This is because of the usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud
            - Providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translate into lower prices

Stop Guessing Capacity
    - When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you usually end up sitting on expensive idle
      resources or dealing with limited capacity
    - Cloud computing allows organizations to stop guessing the capacity requirement for their infrastructure
        - They have access to as much or as little as they need
        - They are able to scale up or down with only a few minutes notice

Increase Speed and Agility
    - New IT resources are one click away
    - Organizations can reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to developers.
    - Increase speed and agility because the time it takes for experimentation and development of computing resources
      is significantly lower.

Focus on Business Differentiators
    - Allowing businesses to focus on their business priorities
        - They do not need to worry about the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers
    - Organizations can stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
    - This allows organizations to focus on projects that differentiate their business
        - Analyzing petabytes of data
        - Delivering video content
        - Building great mobile applications
        - Exploring Mars

Go Global in Minutes
    - Organizations can easily deploy their applications to multiple locations around the world
    - Allowing organizations to provide redundancy across the globe and delivery low latency and better experience to their customer at minimal cost
    - Going global used to be something only the largest enterprise could afford to do, but cloud computing allows this idea for any organization
