Gotcha
    - In 2006, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form
        of web services, now commonly known as cloud computing.
    - Benefits of clouding computing are
        - replacing up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business
            - Businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructures weeks or months in advance.
            - They can instantly spin up hundred or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver faster results.
    - Currently, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable and low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers
      hundreds of thousands of businesses.
